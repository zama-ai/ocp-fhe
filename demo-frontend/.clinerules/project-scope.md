## TL;DR

For this Proof-of-Concept, we recommend developing minimal, standalone smart contracts instead of modifying Fairmint’s existing codebase. This allows us to demonstrate the core functionality with Zama’s FHE integration without inheriting the full architectural complexity of the Fairmint protocol.

## POC Objective

The goal of this PoC is to demonstrate how FHE can enable confidential cap table management on-chain—hiding sensitive investment data while preserving stakeholder access and functionality. While Fairmint provides a rich production-grade implementation, the PoC scope is intentionally narrow and focused on showcasing Zama-based encryption, not replicating the full protocol.
